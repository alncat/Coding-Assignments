1) Prose description of how your game will work, including typical game play with winning and losing.  

	The objective of the game is to destroy as many missiles as possible within the time limit. The team with
	the most destroyed missiles is declared the victor. Missiles that reach the boundaries of the team's 
	city causes the counter for missiles destroyed to be deducted by one. In order for a player to destroy
	a missile, the player needs to click on the missile. A player can one click on a missile every three
	seconds. The game will implement the required WWJ API by using the direction of the wind to control 
	the direction of the in-bound missiles. Additionally, the game will use the common API to 
	geographical represent the cities in the game. 
	


3) A prose description of how your design will implement the required common API as well as any features specific to your implementation.

	Each client will have their own local model and view which is analogous to the ChatApp API.
	In addition each local model will contain a reference to a specialized server model that will be
	running the game. Every action in the local model will trigger an action in the server model
	and the server model in turn updates the local model.
