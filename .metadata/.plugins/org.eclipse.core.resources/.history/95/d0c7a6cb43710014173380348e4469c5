1) Prose description of how your game will work, including typical game play with winning and losing.    (30 pts)

	The objective of the game is to destroy as many missiles as possible within the time limit. The team with
	the most destroyed missiles is declared the victor. Missiles that reach the boundaries of the team's 
	city causes the counter for missiles destroyed to be deducted by one. In order for a player to destroy
	a missile, the player needs to click on the missile. A player can one click on a missile every three
	seconds.
	
2) UML diagram of the interfaces and implementing classes  (5 pts)

	- Missile interface (Look at the code for the ball for direction)
	
	- City interface
	
	- Scoreboard interface
	
	- Player class(-IUser has username and IP) (Team name)
	
	- Team
		- list<player>
		- nation
		- win/lose

3) A prose description of how your design will implement the required common API as well as any features specific to your implementation.   The above UML diagram may be imbedded in this document if desired (recommended!).  (20 pts) 

	The game will implement the required common API by using the direction of the wind to control 
	the direction of the in-bound missiles. Additionally, the game will use the common API to 
	geographical represent the cities in the game.

4) Javadocs for the classes and interfaces in the UML diagram.   A minimum detail level of class/interface and method descriptions is required.   Descriptions of fields and input parameters is recommended but not required.
   The Javadocs should be in the form of HTML web pages so they can be easily read, not just the comments in the code.   (15 pts)
   
   

5) The submitted code should have a minimum functionality of being able to connect to other users and display a map plus any agreed upon functionality as detailed in the Piazza discussions, if any.  (15 pts)
